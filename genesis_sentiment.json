Add there electricity rate of close to 20c kWh and I am paying almost the same for the highway mile driven with ICE and electric car.\n\nSo, why should I buy a car that makes my life less convenient and costs more? And electric could work well as a 2nd car, but I can just buy a bike and bike to commuter rail, as driving into Boston is a nightmare regardless whether I drive ICE or electirc.",
