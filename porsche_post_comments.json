Since 2020, this has been true for all vehicles made at the company's headquarters, and thus for the 911 and 718 aswell. At the start of 2021, the Development Centre in Weissach and the plant in Leipzig, where the Macan and Panamera models are produced,followed suit. This means that all of the large Porsche sites are already CO2-neutral in terms of operations.\n\nInteresting to note that the several of their vehicles, including the Taycan, are carbon neutral. That means the Taycan has a overall lower C02 footprint than the gas models the second you start driving it, rather than after about 40k or so miles like other EVs. Not sure if it includes C02 impact of the materials extraction, though.",

It's funny that this is always the first thing people think of, but it's actually nuclear's big strength. \n\nWith wind power, for example, you are left with tons and tons of fiberglass blades that you can't recycle at the moment and need to bury; old solar panels that are full of toxic materials get shipped to poor African countries; batteries that you need for both, again, don't currently get recycled and have to get landfilled. Nuclear waste? Well, all the nuclear waste *ever produced* in the US will fit into one warehouse. That's the beauty of nuclear energy - you only need one glass of nuclear fuel to cover your energy needs *for life*. Because of this energy density very little waste gets produced and you can just leave it next to the plant. You don't even need to bury it, there is enough space there to last 100+ years.\n\nSo that's all there is to it. Nuclear waste currently doesn't contribute to any contamination whatsoever (unless there are accidents, of course) and won't in the foreseeable future - which can't be said of any other zero emission energy source. Also, contrary to popular perception, nuclear waste doesn't stay radioactive for thousands of years. Well, yes, it does, but not in amounts that are actually dangerous. What you are really worried about are the elements that have a short to medium half-lives, like Iodine-131, Strontium-90 or Caesium-134/137. The shorter the half-life the more radioactive the element is. The elements that stay radioactive for thousands of years, like Uranium-238 or Plutonium-239 are not radioactive enough to be dangerous. That's why you can go on a tourist tour of Chernobyl today, 35 years after, and be completely fine - even though what happened there was completely uncontained.",

MONEY.\n\nReactors are not that simple, especially with all the safety systems that make generation III+ reactors cost more than twice as much as their predecessors with very little changes to the power production side of things. At the same time, wind and solar aren't that complex either. The key point here is that neither renewable nor nuclear is a mainstream industry that has big lobbies like coal and oil. Renewables are at the fringe despite decades of good press. And nuclear has consistently had bad press because, well, despite the fact it kills way fewer people than fossil fuel across a large time scale, the few people who do suffer from NPP accidents almost lose everything. Much easier for the individual person to let every person across the world lose 5 years of their lifespan than take a 0.01% risk of losing their lives, families, friends and entire hometown if a power plant nearby has a core meltdown.",

I'd like to see that gone permanently. It and all other fossil fuels are an abomination. Well to be completely fair, they were a necessary part of human civilization, but now we know better and we have the technology to do better.\n\n> One day when we have methods to efficiently store large amounts of power we can easily go full wind/solar/hydro, but nuclear can be a very useful tool prior to that point.\n\nSo you agree with my original statement that nuclear is not the answer long-term. I personally think that the initial financial outlay and multi-year planning required to set up a nuclear power plant would be better spent investing in energy storage methods so we can hasten full reliance on renewables.",

Nuclear is most useful as a coal replacement in the medium term and the less reliant we are on coal the better. I also think you're overestimating the role of water vapor in global warming as the amount produced by nuclear power still beats other base load generators for their own greenhouse gasses (outside of hyrdo).\n\nLong term nuclear isn't the awnser no, but we need solutions for the medium term too but with enough spending we can work on shorter term solutions alongside longer term ones. I think we can both agree not enough is being spent on energy infrastructure, I just don't think it's prudent to plan around tech that's well beyond the horizon. We shouldn't stop building roads because we are likely to get flying cars*.\n\n*And no, I'm not saying flying cars will make sense, but you get the idea",
