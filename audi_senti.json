Even with a fairly efficient electricity->hydrogen->synth fuel process, by the time you transport it and burn it you're probably getting well under 20% end-to-end. Unless your renewable energy source is almost free, using 4 times the energy to move the vehicle doesn't make sense except for some edge cases.\n\nAs much as I dislike hydrogen as a fuel ( it has its own problems ) it probably makes sense for those cases ( like long haul trucking ) where batteries don't work well for one reason or another.\n\nIt has to be a pretty special application requiring, as you say, dense energy at room temperature and pressure... Aviation is the only one that comes to mind... I'm sure there are others, but aviation is probably the only one that consumes huge amounts of fuel.

They give a car a sense of being alive and are capable of making noises which are better than music to us car enthusiasts.\n2. ICE cars are lighter than BEVs which is generally favorable for handling characteristics. \n3. There is bigger variety between different types of engines, Piston, rotary, NA, Turbo, Supercharger, cylinder count, fuel injection, materials and so on... While electric motors \"act\" much more similar to one another, making BEVs less varied.\n4. The fact that the ICE is a technology that has been continuously developed for 100+ years. Millions of man hours being put in to making small or big improvements, constantly finding different strategies to combat different problems. For me it would really be sad if such a great invention like the ICE, with all the investment of time, money and effort would go lost.\n\nOnly car enthusiasts will care about the reasons I just listed and agree. People who only see the car as an appliance will most probably not really feel strongly about any of the points I just made.",

That means even though the initial cost is higher but the total cost of ownership is better *right now* we're steadily progressing towards lower initial cost AND lower TCO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>2: The average age of a car in the US is about 12 years old. What is the process and cost of replacing battery packs in a 12 year old car?\n\nUhh the same process of repairing anything on a vehicle? Diagnose the issue- troubleshoot the components - Replace faulty components.\n\nFor your standard EV, your average consumer will pretty much never replace A WHOLE battery pack (other than something like the LG/GM recall). Most EV battery pack are made up of modules and if there's an issue with one of them you just replace the module. \n\nAs for cost, it depends on the vehicle. A Nissan Leaf new  whole replacement pack from Nissan for example is about $4500. But once again, that's something most EV buyers never have to worry about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>3: Lithium Ion fires are dangerous and require special equipment to essentially choke them. How many municipalities have that capacity?\n\nHuh? You know China has been moving to EVs for a decade now right?

Most people are able to charge at home or work. Even for those that cant what does it matter if \"it's only a little bit cheaper\"? Even if the cost was the same that's not a deterrent nor an incentive is it? How it that going to stop EV adoption?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>6: Charging at home works if you own a SFH. Row houses, condos and apartments are left with maybe a handful of spots or no way to charge (and again, likely higher charging rates)\n\nThat makes up approximately 16% of the US population, not all of which even own vehicles, even fewer still purchase new vehicles. Even if literally none of those people convert it will have almost no effect on the shift to EVs. That's ignoring most of those people actually would have a way to charge if they did. Even if that's just fast charging at the grocery store.\n\n>7: Lithium mining is dirty and also a limited resource.\n\nConcern trolling. No one that mentions this actually cares about the topic. It they did the would spend the minimum effort to learn all resource extraction has a cost and in comparison to ICE vehicles is superior in every way.",

Speaking of which, add in special disposal for EVs over normal Cars.\n\nJust because you make stuff up on the fly doesn't make it true. Most EVs won't have to have their battery pack replaced in their lifetime. Same as ICE vehicles and engines. There is literally nothing more difficult about disposing EVs over ICE or hybrids. The valuable components are removed and the rest is melted down.\n\nDon't know where you live but around here the RAV4 starts at $26k and the Hybrid $29k. With a highway fuel economy of 35mpg vs 38mpg I would never make up the difference.\n\nThen don't buy an EV. Your situation isn't the same as everyone else.",

Spending an extra 30k every 5-10 years amounts to a lot. Certainly more than a couple grand on bikes or stereo systems.
