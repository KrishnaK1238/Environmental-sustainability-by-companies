The problem with legacy auto and EVs is that the transition will necessarily be painful because you have to still make money while funding and getting consumers to buy the new technology. VW is the only big auto to really take that challenge on. So what GM is doing here is using it's major market position to signal to the rest of the industry that 2035 is the date we're all going to quit ICE and go to EVs, which protects them from the risk of having to convince consumers on their own. It also tells legislators to set that as a realistic date to ban the sale of new ICE, further protecting them from negative economics. If you look at existing ICE bans, the UK and other EU countries have already set 2030 as the date, while CA has set 2035. GM sees the writing on the wall and is trying to seize a leadership role.     \n\nTesla doesn't have to worry about any of this because they don't have a legacy ICE business to manage, nor do they need to worry about investors expecting dividends.",

Now Tesla's spinning up production of their next gen batteries which have even better tech, faster charging, cheaper and faster production.\n\nSome people are dismissing EVs going on info from 5 years ago. That's ancient history. Info from 2 years ago is already very obsolete. The only reason people think \"ICEs aren't going away soon\" is they haven't realized how fast things are *already* changing.",

I did that once from NoVA to Alabama, and I lost about an hour in total travel time. When I traveled with my family to Maine, we didn't lose any time because my kids can't just sit in a car for 12 hour straight, so we get out every 3 hrs, use the restroom, change the toddler, get a snack, and the car is already past the 80-85% charge threshold before we even get back to it.  \n\nAs far as work travel, my office and most of my clients have EV charging on the premises (which will be the standard everywhere soon enough), so range is not really a consideration. I'm sure there are jobs that are exceptions to the rule, but we're talking about the average person at the moment, so I think the case is already there.   \n\nAnd like you said, EVs will get better so that more and more non-average use cases are covered.

I just did a quick check of the Seattle area ski spots:\n\nCrystal Mountain: has RV shore power you can theoretically use for $10 if there is no RV in the spot. But every weekend day of the ski season is fully booked for RVs. So functionally 0 there.\n\nStevens Pass: 2 plugs.\n\nSummit at Snoqualmie: 3 plugs at the hill, 2 at a gas station.\n\nMt. Baker: 0\n\nChargers may be cheap to install, but a lot of these places don't have the electrical infrastructure to support that much power currently: some have to kick on the generators for big storms. Not to mention the chargers make clearing the rudimentary dirt parking lots a lot harder for these places so I don't expect rows on rows of chargers. The Model 3 can do the trip, but people get trapped at most of these places 2-3 times a year due to snow, ice storms, blowdowns, or mud slides and have to spend 6+hrs to the whole night in their vehicles and the heating would burn down the batteries a lot faster than a full tank of gas idling. I do see Teslas at the locations, but far less on storm days which tend to be the best for skiing.\n\nI'm not against EVs, but 100% EVs still has some massive hurdles and the EV vs ICE war seems to ignore the compromise that gives the majority of drivers the best of both: PHEVs.",

Even at the moment, the simulated Atkinson-cycle engines that Honda and Toyota are putting in some of their hybrids are pushing 45% Carnot efficiency. With technologies like Mazda's HCCI, numerous camless valve technologies starting to come into maturity, and the relatively fledgling abilities of AI CFD design and high-strength, high-temp additive manufacturing allowing for much more effective chamber and manifold designs, we could be seeing ICEs that run at electric motor-like efficiencies without the power grid demand comfortably within the next 50 years.",
