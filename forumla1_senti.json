            "body": "The problem with ethanol is the way ethanol is produced. \n\nIt is produced in a field using monocultured corn, usually. That means one type plant in a big ass fucking field. Since that one type of plant has zero biodiversity, it's vulnerable to bugs, weather, fungus, and competing plants. Basically, it needs to be babied by tractors, fungicides, fertilizer, irrigation, and pesticides. All that means is to produce corn, you need A LOT of other energy, usually oil derivatives. That other energy *could* be produced renewable, however, that's not scalable if your fertilizer factory and tractors run on the same fuel they are trying to produce.\n\nAnd then a monocultured field has the problem that even when babying it, it goes through different yields. One year, you could have 100% yields, the next year, you could have 130%, and the next year 10%. You can't run an economy on that type of unpredictability unless you have years of storage. And people bitch about wind and solar not being available all the time. Imagine how fucked our economy would be if we had to run on 75% of the oil this year vs last year. \n\nThen you have a refining problem. Turning corn into ethanol is a process that takes A LOT of energy. Nobody has figured out a way to do it efficiently, aka, without using A LOT of energy to make the ethanol.\n\nOkay, put those two problems together, and we will NEVER have an ethanol economy. It just won't happen. It's like growing 10 acres of corn and 5 acres goes to making the ethanol to grow the corn and the other 5 is what you sell. EROEI (Energy return on energy investment) is only about 2-3 for ethanol, and that is really shitty. Worse than solar and wind by a factor of 3-10x (Wind/solar are closer to 10-30). Even the shittiest oil recovery techniques are 10x. \n\nBut a shitty EROEI investment has a niche. That's IF the fuel is more valuable in liquid form, and we don't need a huge volume. AKA specialize uses like long range air travel or rockets.\n\nOkay, now that all of that is discussed, what formula one is probably going to do is buy some corn off the market, grown using diesel burning tractors, transported using diesel trucks, refined using natural gas, and then delivered to the track using diesel trucks. MAYBE they'll use electric trucks and tractors, but it's worth pointing out that electric tractors don't exist right now. And MAYBE they'll use a refining process that uses renewable energy, but they'll have to source those refineries close to their tracks. \n\nThe bottom line, if they are just using ethanol, it's a fucking marketing scam. If they are going through the effort to actually make the entire supply chain zero emissions, it's worth listening to.",

So long as you're BURNING fuel, whether it's hydrocarbons or even hydrogen (there's still some emissions due to lubricating oils and just natural NOx formation), it's not zero emissions - which is another important distinction regulators are going to have to make (whether they target very, very low or zero emissions).\n\nBut as regulations are written right now, you could have the most efficient fuel production method in the world that takes 10x CO2 out of the atmosphere than it puts out when it's burned and uses only magic fairy dust for energy, those cars are STILL not going to be allowed current proposed future regulations because the benefits of the fuel production cycle is not recognized at the vehicle-emission level.\n\nThat said, if that technology existed, I'm sure regulators would be extremely likely to amend proposed regulations to take advantage of that. But, unfortunately, that doesn't exist and what we have now are still not-very-efficient ways of producing synthetic fuel which, although the analysis shows they are cleaner than conventional petroleum fuel, it's not quite so easy to just say \"Yeah, let's do it.\"\n\nSo if regulators aren't prepared to amend regulations to move vehicle emissions to a well-to-wheel (i.e. consider the fuel production cycle) basis then there is very little incentive for anyone to invest heavily in that technology or to bring it to market on a large scale because you'd be making a huge investment for cars that will soon (15-20 years) not be able to be legally sold or driven. And it doesn't mean 15-20 years of vehicle sales because you still have to develop the technology, ramp up production, and roll everything out, which is by itself going to take years.\n\nFinally, combustion is combustion. Removing CO2 is good and all, but there will always be the matter of NOx, particulate matter, and other forms of emissions that is not CO2 that you cannot avoid with combustion. You can remove most of it with aftertreatment but you still have cold-start emissions (which already makes up the bulk of emissions) and emissions due to catalyst degradation, etc. So are we deciding that we're okay with that? Or do we want to target zero? Another difficult question for regulators to decide which will have a huge impact on the idea of renewable fuels for ICE.",

Its probably not relevant to this discussion, but the other thing that gets me about ethanol is that corn is a terrible plant to use for it.

Bluetooth audio is standard, and Apple Carplay is an option. \n\n>Also how are you finding the long gear ratios? The only complaint anyone ever has about the GT4 is the gear ratios.\n\nRegarding gearing it's not great for the street, and unfortunately all manual 718s (as far as I know) share the same gearing. The problem is exasperated by the higher redline on the 4.0 engine cars. But this is really the norm for high powered manual cars and Porsche products (even 987s and 997s had long gears, they're geared for near 200 mph top speeds on the autobahn). The engine has plenty of torque though, so you don't feel the need to redline it, but it sure encourages it. 2nd tops out above the highest speed limit in all of Canada, so I would say that self control / punishments for speeding should be considerations.\n\nMy take is that the gear ratios only ever come up as a problem because in North America they're really the \"only\" shortcoming of the car. Every high powered manual transmission car has this same issue, a lot of people don't realize the 992 GT3 has the same or higher top speed in every gear (manual v manual) as the GT4. The Lotus Evora 400/GT has similar gearing as well. (And is another car I HIGHLY recommend checking out if you like the GT4). \n\nHope that helps.",

You can get about 10x the protein out of the same area of land. \n\nThe only reason it hasn't happened is because of the backwardfuckingass way the USA approaches food. We've been subsidizing corn to make it cheap AF to fatten up a bunch of pig, cows, and chickens. That has been under the thinly vailed bullshit idea that we need to feed the world. Ignoring that 95% of the grain goes right into the mouth of an animal to make expensive meat. But that meat is heavily subsidized because Iowa. The US has really created a monopoly on itself because it doesn't allow other countries to subsidize their meat in the same way using \"free\" trade agreements. \n\nThat makes US meat super cheap. But growing a full blown animal will never be able to compete with the real cost of production of meat substitutes. That's because you can get rid of all the waste of growing a pig leg or hair or whatever. And you don't have to wait 1-5 years for the animal to grow to harvest size. Instead, you stick some plants in a vat and 3 days later you have a meat substitute. We're probably looking at in 3-5 years buying meat-substitute ground beef for around 1/2 the cost of the real thing. \n\nIt's only a matter of time before impossible meats and beyond meat and whoeverbeantypeburger ends up pushing out beef manufacturers for a McDonnalds burger. Most likely, you aren't buying McDonnalds because of their care in making a Michellen star burger. You are buying it because it offers good value. A filling, tasty meal on a few dollars. Meat substitutes will be able to do that better than the US beef industry. And there is no way traditional beef manufacturers are going to be able to cut costs to stay in business. \n\nRural America is sooooo fucked in like 5-10 years. Maybe not though.",

My main concern there is that the nearest dealer is a 3.5 hour drive away and I worry about parts support etc.  I also hear issues with the leather pulling back from the dash in the sun (and I'm in Texas), though that might have been fixed.  \n\nBut I do love the way it looks. And I love Lotus as a company in principle.  I also love that it still has hydraulic power steering.  I haven't driven a modern Porsche but I'm yet to find an electric rack that feels as good as my E90.\n\nI didn't realize the Evora had similar gearing to the 718 though.  So that's something to consider.\n\nI'll also need to decide if the cabin noise is something I can deal with, won't know until I drive one.  \n\nBut yes, most people concede that the only reason the gearing is brought up for the GT4 is that the car is otherwise so achingly perfect you have a find a nit to pick.\n\nThanks for the info!",

For convenience, I'll round the actual figures a bit but it won't affect the end result enough to make a difference.\n\nFirst, some definitions:\n\n* Volume of one TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit, or the volume of one 20ft shipping container): [~32 m^3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-foot_equivalent_unit#Equivalence)\n\n* Volume of one LD39 container (largest standard air cargo container, only fits in the 747): [~16 m^3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_load_device#Types) or 0.5 TEU\n\nNow, according to [this F1 article](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.how-does-an-f1-team-get-two-cars-and-42-tonnes-of-freight-to-australiato-australia.7980SpcLE9VSvmBA7qGEA5.html), each of the 10 teams supposedly needs to move around 50 tons of cargo in 12 air cargo containers, as well as another 10 tons by sea.\n\nFor the air cargo, that adds up to 500 tons and 120 air cargo containers which, assuming they use the largest air cargo containers, is equivalent to a volume of 60 TEU.\n\nFor the sea cargo, the total mass adds up to 100 tons, and assuming the density of the sea cargo is roughly the same as the density of the air cargo (500 tons per 60 TEU, or ~10 tons per TEU), the volume would be 10 TEU.\n\nThat brings the grand total to 600 tons and 70 TEU. The St. Helena can carry [1800 tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_St_Helena_(1989\\)) and [92 TEU](http://rms-st-helena.com/2017/10/05/st-helena-line-withdraw-rms-st-helena-service-seeks-buyer-vessel/).\n\nConclusion: The St. Helena could quite comfortably transport the entire F1 circus in one go, with room to spare.",

My main concern there is that the nearest dealer is a 3.5 hour drive away and I worry about parts support etc.\n\nYeah same deal for me and that contributed to me purchasing the GT4. With only one dealer within 10 hours of driving any direction, it would have been pretty risky. You either accept what that dealer says or pound sand (assuming you don't have a local indy shop / Lotus specialist).\n\n>But I do love the way it looks. And I love Lotus as a company in principle. I also love that it still has hydraulic power steering. I haven't driven a modern Porsche but I'm yet to find an electric rack that feels as good as my E90.\n\nThe steering on the Evora is absolutely amazing. Possibly the best rack I've ever driven, I'd say it's tied with the 997.2 GTS or close enough that I'd have to drive them back to back to say definitively. If I can remember, the 997 had a bit more lively steering (typical 911 stuff because the front end is so light) that danced in your hands, but the actual feeling of the surface was excellent with both. The 718 GT4 steering is about as good as EPAS gets as far as I can tell. I'd say it's on par with good hydraulic racks, but still a little behind the best hydraulic racks like those I just mentioned. The Evora also feels a faster around town than the GT4 despite actually being slower (or at least the 410 Sport I drove did) because of the theatre. The titanium sport exhaust was properly loud (even louder than the GT4 with valves open), it pulled hard through the gears and had plenty of low RPM torque thanks to the supercharger, and it garnered a lot of attention. If reliability/maintenance/value retention weren't concerns I believe the Evora 410 Sport was the better sports car for the street, but just not the better car to live with.  \n\n>I'll also need to decide if the cabin noise is something I can deal with, won't know until I drive one.\n\nFor sure, hope you get the opportunity to drive one and the GTS 4.0 which is a little bit quieter and softer from what I hear.",

You can get an idea on how much of an impact renewables are having by accessing the CO2 emissions data from EPAs website. They've helped but it will be nowhere near what you are expecting. Just a case in point, most people will charge their vehicles at night when solar is not producing any power. You will be charging your vehicle with power almost 100% derived from fossil fuel. If you realized this and decided \"Hell, I'll just charge my vehicle during the day then.\" think again because utilities can't effectively create an additional source of renewable power generation for when you decide to plug in your car. There is 'x' amount of power produced from renewables and they will always operate at max capacity. Renewables can be considered base loaded plants. They are not capable of following the demand on the power grid. They just put out 100% of whatever power they can produce. Any variable load will be picked up by fossil fuel plants and most likely those will be aero-derivative simple cycle units which are not very efficient... as a matter of fact, they are about as efficient as an old 1970's boiler power plant. Utilities are being forced to use these less efficient fossil fuel units because they can quickly adjust to renewables erratic output. So when you plug your car in during the day it is an additional variable load on the system and will be covered by that less efficient aero-derivative fossil fuel unit.\n\nIf you want to know how efficient your EV is, try to see if your power supplier releases data on how efficient their power generation is on a whole. Use that number and substract the transmission and energy conversion losses.\n\n>the power required to distill and produce gasoline, transport it, distribute it, etc\n\nAh, but crude oil isn't only distilled to produce gasoline to power motor vehicles. Only 40% of a barrel of crude oil is used for gasoline.",

You definitely need to drive it. I have driven multiple modern BMWs and they have some of the WORST EPAS setups I have ever used. I recently drove an M2, I'll link the post, and my number one complaint was the god awful steering. This is no exaggeration, the steering in the M2 was almost less feelsome than in my Golf. It was WAY behind the ND2 Miata. And not even playing in the same ballpark as the GT4. So there is a really wide range of quality of EPAS steering. The GT4 is the best, I'd say other Porsche products are very good as well (991.2s/718s that I've driven), the ND2 is up there but not quite on par. If the GT4 steering was a 9/10 the M2 steering would be maybe a 2/10.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/pw4zcv/finally_drove_a_manual_bmw_m2_and_now_im_just/",

My car after this is 99% going to be EV.  It'll be a sad day but it's also inevitable.  So for what I think is going to be my \"best\" car I might go all out.  Like I said, I won't know until I actually order the thing.",
