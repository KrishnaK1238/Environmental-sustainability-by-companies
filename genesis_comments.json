I can certainly keep it going long enough to hit the point where an EV model I like becomes available *and* I save up enough money so as to not have an outrageous loan period on it when I get the keys.

I bought my Tesla here in MN because Tesla *wants* to sell their cars and people *want* to buy them. That's because BEVs sell incredibly well and have high profit margins.\n\nGood luck getting one. Because of how the economics are working out you're only going to get less and less opportunity to buy a PHEV. $5k over MSRP without the options you want may be the best deal you'll see unless you wait to get one used.",

Most people are in the habit of fueling up for road trips just like most people were in the habit of texting with physical keyboards. The idea of being 100% dependant on charging is a new thing and that fact alone makes people anxious just like the idea of touch screen typing was new.\n\nThe last keyboard Android I had I ended up regretting having the keyboard because swype ended up being so much better. Once I stopped using the keyboard it was just this extra, bulky, useless piece of equipment. Shortly after that I stopped seeing new phones with physical keyboards. More costly to produce and people discovered they didn't need or want them. Once again: the manufacturer is going to go the route of cutting production costs and you can't do that with PHEVs.\n\nI'd never buy a PHEV because I'm now familiar with what it's like to have a 100% BEV and I've witnessed the fast charging network get built out around me at great speed. If I buy a new PHEV now with a 5 year loan I can see that before it's even paid off I'd lament having essentially a short-range EV with a gas engine in a world of full BEVs and fast charging. Oher people would have vehicles that are significantly more powerful than mine but just as capable for road trips and camping.\n\nIf Tesla is the iPhone of EVs who's going to be the Android of EVs and who's going to be the Nokia/BB/Windows Phone of EVs? Until there's a clear \"Android\" EV I can't see spending any good money unless it's a Tesla or repairs on our 2010 Outback. Otherwise I'd feel like a bag holder.",
