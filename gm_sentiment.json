The problem with legacy auto and EVs is that the transition will necessarily be painful because you have to still make money while funding and getting consumers to buy the new technology. VW is the only big auto to really take that challenge on. So what GM is doing here is using it's major market position to signal to the rest of the industry that 2035 is the date we're all going to quit ICE and go to EVs, which protects them from the risk of having to convince consumers on their own. It also tells legislators to set that as a realistic date to ban the sale of new ICE, further protecting them from negative economics. If you look at existing ICE bans, the UK and other EU countries have already set 2030 as the date, while CA has set 2035. GM sees the writing on the wall and is trying to seize a leadership role.     \n\nTesla doesn't have to worry about any of this because they don't have a legacy ICE business to manage, nor do they need to worry about investors expecting dividends.",

Pre-covid, I did many 1,000+ mile road trips in an 315 mi range Tesla 3, and also occasionally travel for work, so I do have an idea of what I'm talking about.  \n\nI'll be more than honest that if I am trying to drive 1,000 miles as fast as absolutely possible, then current EVs are not going to win that race. I did that once from NoVA to Alabama, and I lost about an hour in total travel time. When I traveled with my family to Maine, we didn't lose any time because my kids can't just sit in a car for 12 hour straight, so we get out every 3 hrs, use the restroom, change the toddler, get a snack, and the car is already past the 80-85% charge threshold before we even get back to it.  \n\nAs far as work travel, my office and most of my clients have EV charging on the premises (which will be the standard everywhere soon enough), so range is not really a consideration. I'm sure there are jobs that are exceptions to the rule, but we're talking about the average person at the moment, so I think the case is already there.   \n\nAnd like you said, EVs will get better so that more and more non-average use cases are covered. At the very least, there is no reason for a 2-car family to not consider an EV for one of their vehicles right now.",
